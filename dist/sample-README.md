# My Cool Project
  ![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

  ## Description
  A good description section is concise and to the point. It should detail what your project is for. Overall, any README.md should provide succinct instructions and resources for the project. Keep this in mind as you write each section. If your project demands more detail be communicated, consider including those details, resources, and instructions in documentation. You can link to the documentation in your README.md.

  ## Installation
  This section should detail the prerequisites and installation instructions for your project. In other words, if someone clones your repository, tell them how to set up the project so that they can use it on their own machine. For example, this README.md generator has dependencies that must be installed in order for it to work. The installation section includes instructions on where to install dependencies and how to do so from the command line. Not every project needs an installation section, but a good rule of thumb is that anything that does NOT run in the browser environment should have this section. Web apps can require installation, too. Furthermore, if someone wants to run your application on their own machine (even a browser app), you’ll need this section if you included dependencies, plug-ins, or other things that do not come with a download or repo clone. So include installation instructions!

  
  ## Usage
  Your usage section should walk the reader/user through a step-by-step guide for use of project. If you built a web application, show how users can interact with your app. If you built a project that runs somewhere other than a browser environment (like this command line app), demonstrate how to use your app with a step-by-step guide. You can include include code blocks by enclosing them in three backticks, like so: ``` // my code block ```. If you need to include a link anywhere in your section paragraphs, format them like this: ``` [<link text>](<url>)```. If you want to include images, you can do so with either a url or relative path. If including your own images, remember to add them to a folder in your project. When entering them into the command line, use the following syntax:  ```/* for images from the internet */ ![<alt-text>](<url>) /* for images in your directory */ ![<alt-text>](</your/relative/path.png>) ```. You don’t need to create links for the questions/contact, contributing, license, or table of contents section. The app will take care of those for you.
